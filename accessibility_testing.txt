How might a non-impaired user might benefit from increased web accessibility
(that isn’t already discussed above)?

Increased web accessibility, even for a non-impaired user, means a cleaner,
easier-to-use user experience. More diverse groups of people can use
accessible websites, as people may be trying to find different
kinds of information. Making the website easy to use ultimately means
that more people can derive a use from the website.


What are three design choices that User Inyerface made that harmed your user
experience? Explain how you would alter each design choice to improve
accessibility and usability.

Green button saying no is very unintuitive not to press since we associate
green with "go". Also, the green button served no purpose, though the
color change and round shape, to me, suggested that it was something
I needed to press. Finally, the click was underlined and underlining
usually means a link, even though it didn't direct anywhere.
I'd get rid of the no in the button and the small font at the bottom, and
perhaps change the button to direct to the next page.

What are three changes you made to your site to increase your Lighthouse
(or other) audit score? Explain how each change increases your site’s
performance or accessibility.

I added a meta tag. Meta tags are important because this is how the page
can communicate with search engines, which affect how easy it is to find
the page.

I changed my images to have an alt tag. This allows people who are
visually-impaired to be able to know what the image is.

I added a language tag. This helps web crawlers (making it easier to
find information about the site) and screen readers (which aid the visually-
impaired) know the language of the page.
