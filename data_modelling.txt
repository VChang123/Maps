The dataset you created was not bias-free. What are some assumptions that the
developers of Mockaroo made about the types you explored? Who might be left
out of the dataset? Consider the falsehoods you explored earlier.

The developers assumed that:
- everyone has a name that follows UTF-8 characters or at least has an
    "English" sounding name.
- people don't have more than 1 first name
- people live in places with English-sounding roads
- these addresses are distinct and don't require a zipcode

When you made decisions about how you modelled your dataset, you made
predictions about what future data you would be encountering. How did you
make these decisions? Can you think of any edge cases that might break your
model?

I assumed that some people wouldn't want to put their last names, might not
have an email address, or didn't feel comfortable putting in their addresses.
An edge case that might break my model is if someone didn't have a name or
didn't have anywhere fixed to live.


In this assignment we ask you to build an extensible REPL. How have you made
your REPL extensible (beyond accessing multiple commands)? Letâ€™s say you wanted
to reuse your REPL code. What changes need to be made (if any) to your REPL?
Consider the inversion-of-control reading and Lecture 2.

Besides making it easier access to multiple commands, I haven't built a very
extensible REPL, I'm not realizing. Instead of parsing the command line
input inside of the REPL, it might be better to parse within the individual
methods because the regex pattern needed might be different. Also, I realized
while creating my MockPerson that having my execute functions take in a
starsList is not an extensible, so I may need to change that.
